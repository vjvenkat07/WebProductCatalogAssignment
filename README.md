If price based filtering is not provided due to time constraint, it is acceptable but broken functionality should not be submitted in the final PR

3. **Naming Conventions (High Priority)** - All the variables and functions should be named in a way that it represents what is purpose of having that variable/function in the code. Also the naming should be consistent across the code whether it be camel case or snake case or something else.
